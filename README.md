### Business / Goals / Communication

* Ensure the code addresses business needs.

* Never make any assumptions. If you do, then document it.
* Make everything visible.
* Achieve optimal outcome by balancing cost and value.
* Keep three todo lists: today, near-term, long-term.

### Big picture / System thinking / Future state / Vision / Architecture / Matching requirements / Non-functional reqs

* Focus on the overall vision, understand the big picture.
* Consider how the application fits into the whole ecosystem.
* Evaluate decisions with a long-term view: Consider a fearute's impact on the overall system. Does it make it hard to add features tomorrow? Make others aware.
* Understand requirements and constraints, design high-level architecture, then evolve it over time. Work with the team to specify shapes, patterns, inner structure, logic and then work with the team implementing it.
* Learn about cross-functional (non-functional) requirements.
* Shape the overall solution that meets all requirements.
* Steer technical vision and arch changes
* Step back to see if the project still heading in the right direction.
* Understand the layered architecture, hexagonal architecture, DDD, the Connascence and how to remove it.
* Recognize the root cause and not be distracted by symptoms.

* Do not keep all the most important work/decisions to yourself as it will make you a bottleneck and will make others feel undervalued. Deleagate.
* After technology there are two other main areas to ensure success: people and process.

### Other

* They often concerned more about code maintainability than saving few CPU/Memory resources with tricky optimizations.
* Ensure that others can understand the solution when reviewing code.
* Manage debt to make easier to add code.
* Agree on the problem before entertaining solutions.

* They consider discussions without outcome to be useless.
* Prioritizatoin and decision making is hard so do it when you're fresh in the morning.
