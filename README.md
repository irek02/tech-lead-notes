* Ensure that others can understand the solution when reviewing code.
* Manage debt to make easier to add code.

* They consider discussions without outcome to be useless.
* Prioritizatoin and decision making is hard so do it when you're fresh in the morning.

## PEOPLE

Develop soft skills.
Learn nonviolent comminucation.

Focus on the path to production. Work backwards from the delivery date and initial vision.

Work with the business to understand how much work can be done and help prioritize.

Do not enforce idead but steer in the right direction loosely.

Choose the task that will unblock others rather than the task that you want to work on.

Look out for code smells, anti-patterns, maintainability issues and let the team take ownership in resolving them.

After technology there are two other main areas to ensure success: people and process.

Achieve optimal outcome by balancing cost and value.

In the daily grind, frequently revisit the priority list to ensure you are not creating waste.

Give others room to make mistakes and grow.

Encourage others to challenge your ideas.
Create a blameless culture.

Make yourself redundant.
Unblock others to promote self-organization.

Keep three todo lists: today, near-term, long-term.

You will no longer have luxury of diving into technical challenges without interruptions.

Learn to work under pressure. Slipping on the discipline is unprofessional and will be costly.

Make personal connections for more effective work.

## TECH

Shape the overall solution that meets all requirements.

Agree on the problem before entertaining solutions.

Expose risks to external steakholders and lobby for resources to address them.

Never make any assumptions.

Don't take on more than you can handle. Don't put yourself on the critical path and become a bottleneck. Share your role to spread the load.

Enable the team to succeed.

Design solutions by establishing patterns and keeping an eye on the troubled aread of the project.

Learn about new techniques and frameworks.

Learn Mikago method. Explain things to managemtn by drawing dependency diagrams.

Review team's design decisions and provide feedback to prevent a slow down due to a coupling.

Encourage developers to own the whole process: from capturing reqs through to the delivery and ops.

Ensure that the delivered change also delivers value which is to prevent developers exporing their own interests.

Understand the layered architecture, hexagonal architecture, DDD, the Connascence and how to remove it.
Work with the team to specify shapes, patterns, innder structure, logic and then work with the team implementing it.

Recognize the root cause and not be distracted by symptoms.

Document assumptions.

## BUSINESS

Establish continous delivery as a trust building mechanism with business.

Learn to communicate with non-technical people. Use diagrams, whiteboard, metaphors, simple language without acronyms and tech terms.

Do not over commit without without the teams involvement.

Remind the team how their software moves the business towards the goal.
Help the team understand the business goal and transform it into a system.

Find balance in delivery pace and code quality to satisfy both the team and the business.

Help the project from the business and technical perspective but never spend 100% of time in only one area for too long.

When disagreeing with something, understand whether it jeapardizes the project or just a personal preference.

Ensure the team nonfunctional goals (test coverage, use of specific technology) are in line with business (end user) requirements.

Remain non-emotional. Make decision after you heard everyone and stick to it. However, let other have a victory once in a while.

Make everything visible. Use personal kanban.

Push decisions on others to foster their leadership skills.
